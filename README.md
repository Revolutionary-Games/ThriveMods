# ThriveMods

Official and example Thrive mods

We don't currently accept community mods into this repo, you need to put them elsewhere.

## Example Mods

- [Disco Nucleus](DiscoNucleus/): shows how to replace an existing asset in Thrive


## Exporting

There's a helper script provided (`export_all.rb`) that exports and
prepares folders for all mods in this repository. For how to get the
script working, please refer to
[Thrive setup instructions](https://github.com/Revolutionary-Games/Thrive/blob/master/doc/setup_instructions.md)
If you prefer you can also manually use Godot editor to export specific mods.
