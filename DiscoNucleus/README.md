DiscoNucleus
============

This is an example mod showing how a default file in the game can be
overridden.

Replaces the nucleus texture with a disco ball.

The important part is to match the Thrive file structure so that the
resulting mod .pck has right paths.

Asset only mods that have the same texture format settings for all
platforms, need only be exported for a single platform.

- disco.jpg is a modified version of an asset contained in Thrive
